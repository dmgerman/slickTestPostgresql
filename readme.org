* Introduction

This is a simple example of how to use slick with postgresql. 

I found it confusing at the beginning and the tutorials I found where either over complicated or did not completely
work.

The tutorial:

- Drops a table if exists
- Creates a table
- Inserts some tuples (in two inserts)
- Does two selects
  - without a where clause
  - with a where clause


* How to run


You must modified the file ./src/main/resources/application.conf  with the corresponding connection parameters.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
postgresDB {
  url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/scala"
  driver = org.postgresql.Driver
  user="dmg"
  password=${DB_PG_PWD}
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Simply clone, modify application.conf and

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sbt run
#+END_SRC

The output should be something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Acme, Inc.: 99 Market Street : Groundsville
Superior Coffee: 1 Party Place : Mendocino
Habit Coffee: 190 Pandora St : Victoria
----------------------------------------
Habit Coffee: 190 Pandora St : Victoria
#+END_EXAMPLE

Enjoy!
